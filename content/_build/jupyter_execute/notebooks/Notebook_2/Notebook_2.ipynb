    "It isn't typically possible to accurately measure surface runoff directly on a *continuous* basis.  Instead, in practice it is much easier and more reliable to install an instrument in the river to measure pressure, which recall is a linear function of the depth of water.  A hydrometric station is often simply a pressure transducer (below) connected to a device to store measurements in memory (such as a data logger).  We then need a way to map these recorded water depth measurements -- referred to as 'stage' measurements -- to **volumetric flow** ($\\frac{m^3}{s}$).\n",

During each measurement, we manually measure the water level to validate the data being recorded continuously by our pressure transducer and datalogger (hydrometric station).  We validate the pressure transducer reading because instrument calibration is not perfect, and can change over time for a number of reasons.  It is important to measure stage by some independent means before and after a discharge measurement in order to to assess the quality of the stage-discharge relationship and any analysis derived from it.  Validating the hydrometric station stage concurrent to a discharge measurement is typically done manually, such as with a benchmark survey.\n"

    "## Summary and Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we have used discrete measurements to develop a relationship between water level and volumetric flow.  We've used this relationship to develop what is commonly called a 'measured flow series' (the plot above at right), but it's really just an estimate of a relationship that changes in time due to natural morphological processes.  As we saw in Notebook 1 there is uncertainty in the measurements themselves, and in this notebook we see there is uncertainty in the stage-discharge relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is typical that the hydrometric station will record a greater range of water level than what is captured during site visits when discrete discharge measurements are taken.  This is because the hydrometric station is installed and left running to measure water level 'continuously' (at some frequency, such as 2 minutes or 15 minutes) for years at a time.  In many cases it isn't practical or cost effective to make more than three or four visits per year to the station to collect measurements, download stage data, check datalogger batteries, etc.  As a result, it is typical to have discrete discharge measurements over a narrower range of flow conditions than is measured by the hydrometric station, so our 'measured flow series' then must *extrapolate* from the range of conditions we have actually taken discrete measurements for.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'measured flow series' is used in many applications in resource engineering.  Low flows are used to determine natural or baseline conditions for fish habitat impact assessments, high flows are used to size hydraulic structures, such as dam spillways.  Hydrometric stations are often installed in new locations to support projects that have multi-decade planning horizons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions for Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the rating curve and measured discharge series are used to characterize a water resource to support decisions in policy and design.  In characterizing a water resource, not only is it common to extrapolate beyond the range of measured conditions, it is necessary to extrapolate into the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a brief discussion (1-2 paragraphs) describing how your confidence in the flow predicted by the rating curve changes as a function of water level?  Compare your level of confidence in the rating curve accurately predicting flow tomorrow, versus one year from now, versus ten years from now.  How might these concerns be addressed?  "
