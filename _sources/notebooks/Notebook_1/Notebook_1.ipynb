    "# Notebook 1: Flow Measurement using the Salt Dilution Method\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Flow measurement by salt dilution](https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.3360070212)$^{[1]}$ is a type of tracer method where the natural conductivity of stream water is temporarily raised by adding (dissolving) a known mass of tracer into the stream, and measuring a response downstream.  Tracer methods can be done by slug injection or steady-state.  A \"slug\" is a known mass of tracer that dissolves and mixes in the stream.  The steady-state method is a constant injection of a dissolved tracer of known concentration.  Both methods are suited to lower flows where a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio can be acheived with a relatively small amount of tracer, and to turbulent flows where adequate mixing of the tracer can be achieved.  Table salt is commonly used for measurement because it is cheap and practical for field measurement, and the concentration and durations are small compared to [observed levels of toxicity](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.01.040)$^{[2]}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the instrument calibration and measurement data processing for a salt dilution streamflow measurement using the slug tracer method.  More information on the steady-state method can be found [here](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.454.1620&rep=rep1&type=pdf&bcgovtm=new%20west%20record).  At the end of this notebook, there is an open ended question that asks you to reflect on the content of the notebook."
