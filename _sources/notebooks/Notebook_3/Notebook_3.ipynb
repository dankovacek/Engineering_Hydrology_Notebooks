    "Recall that our hydrometric station has only been running for a couple of years -- this isn't nearly enough data to estimate the **long term** flow characteristics (daily, seasonal, floods, droughts, etc.).  In this notebook, we look in the vicinity of our project location for other stations where records have been kept for much longer&mdash;ideally with complete historical records of 25+ years.  **It's also critical that we find records that are concurrent with the period we measured at our project location.**  We can use concurrent data from nearby stations to develop a model to estimate flow for periods we didn't actually measure at our project location.  This type of model is called a *regional information transfer* model.\n",
